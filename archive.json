I would assume that it should use the '0'/'1' construction between steps d and f.\r\n\r\n- Jim Schaad: Is there any advantage to padding with 0x01 in step f rather than 0x00?\r\n\r\n- Rene Stuik: MUST instead of RECOMMENDED.",

      "body": "I'd like to let the interested parties know that, I've written a experimental C implementation of the draft. If anyone's interested in benchmarking or any kind of testing, I'd love to assist. I've also raised a few implementation-related issue at [crypto.stackexchange.com/a/106599/36960](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/106599/36960) and I'll summarize here:\r\n\r\n1. The draft treats ECDSA RNG as a white box and penetrates the PRNG boundary to seed it, which is something NIST specifies not to do. This isn't too big an issue, as there are ways to maintain functionality opacity.\r\n\r\n2. The draft underspecifies how to use KMAC when the hash function is SHAKE. The way I prefer is to persuade NIST to specify and approve a permutation-based PRNG and use that instead. However in the interim time, we could add details on how KMAC should be used with HMAC-DRBG, but again, it'll penetrate the PRNG boundary. What's more, KMAC had not been approved for use with HMAC-DRBG yet.",
