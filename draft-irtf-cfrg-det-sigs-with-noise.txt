                   Hedged ECDSA and EdDSA Signatures
               draft-irtf-cfrg-det-sigs-with-noise-latest

Abstract

   Deterministic elliptic-curve signatures such as deterministic ECDSA
   and EdDSA have gained popularity over randomized ECDSA as their
   security does not depend on a source of high-quality randomness.
   Recent research, however, has found that implementations of these
   signature algorithms may be vulnerable to certain side-channel and
   fault injection attacks due to their deterministic nature.  One
   countermeasure to such attacks is hedged signatures where the
   calculation of the per-message secret number includes both fresh
   randomness and the message.  This document updates RFC 6979 and RFC
   8032 to recommend hedged constructions in deployments where side-
   channel attacks and fault injection attacks are a concern.  The
   updates are invisible to the validator of the signature and
   compatible with existing ECDSA and EdDSA validators.

1.  Introduction

   In Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC) signature algorithms, the per-
   message secret number has traditionally been generated from a random
   number generator (RNG).  The security of such algorithms depends on
   the cryptographic quality of the random number generation and biases
   in the randomness may have catastrophic effects such as compromising
   private keys (see e.g., [Bernstein19]).  Repeated per-message secret
   numbers have caused several severe security accidents in practice.
   As stated in [RFC6979], the need for a cryptographically secure
   source of randomness is also a hindrance to deployment of randomized
   ECDSA [FIPS-186-5] in architectures where secure random number
   generation is challenging, in particular, embedded IoT systems and
   smartcards.  [ABFJLM17] does however state that smartcards typically
   have a high-quality RNG on board, which makes it significantly easier
   and faster to use the RNG instead of doing a hash computation.

   In deterministic ECC signatures schemes such as Deterministic
   Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
   [RFC6979][FIPS-186-5] and Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm
   (EdDSA) [RFC8032], the per-message secret number is instead generated
   in a fully deterministic way as a function of the message and the
   private key.  Except for key generation, the security of such
   deterministic signatures does not rely on a source of high-quality
   randomness.  This makes verification of implementations easier.  As
   they are presumed to be safer, deterministic signatures have gained
   popularity and are referenced and recommended by a large number of
   recent RFCs [RFC8037] [RFC8080] [RFC8225] [RFC8387] [RFC8410]
   [RFC8411] [RFC8419] [RFC8420] [RFC8422] [RFC8446] [RFC8463] [RFC8550]
   [RFC8591] [RFC8608] [RFC8624] [RFC9053].

   Side-channel attacks are potential attack vectors for implementations
   of cryptographic algorithms.  Side-Channel attacks can in general be
   classified along three orthogonal axes: passive vs. active, physical
   vs. logical, and local vs. remote [SideChannel].  It has been
   demonstrated how side-channel attacks such as power analysis
   [BCPST14] and timing attacks [Minerva19] [TPM-Fail19] allow for
   practical recovery of the private key in some existing
   implementations of randomized ECDSA.  [BSI] summarizes minimum
   requirements for evaluating side-channel attacks of elliptic curve
   implementations and writes that deterministic ECDSA and EdDSA
   requires extra care.  The deterministic ECDSA specification [RFC6979]
   notes that the deterministic generation of per-message secret numbers
   may be useful to an attacker in some forms of side-channel attacks
   and as stated in [Minerva19], deterministic signatures like [RFC6979]
   and [RFC8032] might help an attacker to reduce the noise in the side-
   channel when the same message it signed multiple times.  Recent
   research [SH16] [BP16] [RP17] [ABFJLM17] [SBBDS17] [PSSLR17] [SB18]
   [WPB19] [AOTZ19] [FG19] have theoretically and experimentally
   analyzed the resistance of deterministic ECC signature algorithms
   against side-channel and fault injection attacks.  The conclusions
   are that deterministic signature algorithms have theoretical
   weaknesses against certain instances of these types of attacks and
   that the attacks are practically feasibly in some environments.
   These types of attacks may be of particular concern for hardware
   implementations such as embedded IoT devices and smartcards where the
   adversary can be assumed to have access to the device to induce
   faults and measure its side-channels such as timing information,
   power consumption, electromagnetic leaks, or sound with low signal-
   to-noise ratio.  A good summary of fault attacks in given by [Cao20].
   See also the discussions and references in [Comments-186-5].

   Fault attacks may also be possible without physical access to the
   device.  RowHammer [RowHammer14] showed how an attacker to induce
   DRAM bit-flips in memory areas the attacker should not have access
   to.  Plundervolt [Plundervolt19] showed how an attacker with root
   access can use frequency and voltage scaling interfaces to induce
   faults that bypass even secure execution technologies.  RowHammer can
   e.g., be used in operating systems with several processes or cloud
   scenarios with virtualized servers.  Protocols like TLS, SSH, and
   IKEv2 that add a random number to the message to be signed mitigate
   some types of attacks [PSSLR17].

   Government agencies are clearly concerned about these attacks.  In
   [Notice-186-5] and [FIPS-186-5], NIST warns about side-channel and
   fault injection attacks, but states that deterministic ECDSA may be
   desirable for devices that lack good randomness.  The quantum-
   resistant ML-DSA [FIPS-204] standardized by NIST uses hedged signing
   by default.  BSI has published [BSI] and researchers from BSI have
   co-authored two research papers [ABFJLM17] [PSSLR17] on attacks on
   deterministic signatures.  For many industries it is important to be
   compliant with both RFCs and government publications, alignment
   between IETF, NIST, and BSI recommendations would be preferable.

   Note that deriving per-message secret number deterministically, is
   also insecure in a multi-party signature setting [RFC9591].

   One countermeasure to entropy failures, side-channel attacks, and
   fault injection attacks recommended by [Langley13] [RP17] [ABFJLM17]
   [SBBDS17] [PSSLR17] [SB18] [AOTZ19] [FG19] and implemented in
   [OpenSSL13a] [OpenSSL13b] [XEdDSA] [libSodium] [libHydrogen] is to
   generate the per-message secret number from a random string, a secret
   key, and the message.  This combines the security benefits of fully
   randomized per-message secret numbers with the security benefits of
   fully deterministic secret numbers.  Such a hedged construction
   protects against key compromise due to weak random number generation,
   but still effectively prevents many side-channel and fault injection
   attacks that exploit determinism.  Hedged constructions require minor
   changes to the implementation and does not increase the number of
   elliptic curve point multiplications and is therefore suitable for
   constrained IoT.  Section 3.6 of [RFC6979] describes a variant of
   deterministic ECDSA that adds non-repeating additional data k' to the
   per-message secret number generation.  Adding randomness to EdDSA is
   not compliant with [RFC8032].  [Kampanakis16] describes an
   alternative [FIPS-186-5] compliant approach where message specific
   pseudo-random information is used as an additional input to the
   random number generation to create per-message secret number.
   [Bernstein14] states that generation of the per-message secret number
   from a subset of a random string, a secret key, the message, and a
   message counter is common in DSA/ECDSA implementations.

   This document updates [RFC6979] and [RFC8032] to recommend hedged
   constructions in deployments where side-channel and fault injection
   attacks are a concern.  The updates are invisible to the validator of
   the signature.  Produced signatures remain fully compatible with
   unmodified ECDSA and EdDSA verifiers and existing key pairs can
   continue to be used.  As the precise use of random bytes is
   specified, test vectors can still be produced, see Section 6, and
   implementations can be tested against them.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Hedged EdDSA

   This document updates RFC 8032 (EdDSA) to recommend hedged variants
   of EdDSA for deployments where side-channel attacks and fault
   injection attacks are a concern, the variants are called hedged
   EdDSA.  The updates are invisible to the validator of the signature
   and compatible with existing EdDSA validators.

   Update to RFC 8032:

   For Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519: In deployments where side-
   channel and fault injection attacks are a concern, the following step
   is RECOMMENDED instead of step (2) in Section 5.1.6 of [RFC8032]:

   2.  Compute the digest SHA-512(prefix || Z), where Z is 32 octets of
       random data. Let prefix’ denote the leftmost half of the digest.
       Compute SHA-512(dom2(F, C) || prefix’ || PH(M)), where M is the
       message to be signed.  Interpret the 64-octet digest as a
       little-endian integer r.

   For Ed448ph and Ed448: In deployments where side-channel and fault
   injection attacks are a concern, the following step is RECOMMENDED
   instead of step (2) in Section 5.2.6 of [RFC8032]:

  2.  Compute the digest SHAKE256(prefix || Z, 114), where Z is 57
      octets of random data. Let prefix’ denote the leftmost half of
      the digest. Compute SHAKE256(dom4(F, C) || prefix’ || PH(M), 114),
      where M is the message to be signed,  F is 1 for Ed448ph, 0 for
      Ed448, and C is the context to use. Interpret the 114-octet digest
      as a little-endian integer r.

4.  Hedged ECDSA

   This document updates RFC 6979 (deterministic ECDSA) to recommend a
   hedged variant of ECDSA for deployments where side-channel attacks
   and fault injection attacks are a concern, the variant is called
   hedged ECDSA.  The updates are invisible to the validator of the
   signature and compatible with existing ECDSA validators.

   Update to RFC 6979: In ECDSA deployments where side-channel and fault
   injection attacks are a concern, the following steps are RECOMMENDED
   instead of steps (d) and (f) in Section 3.2 of [RFC6979]:

d.  Set:

       K = HMAC_K(V || 0x00 || Z || 000... || int2octets(x) || 000...
       || bits2octets(h1))

    where '||' denotes concatenation.  In other words, we compute
    HMAC with key K, over the concatenation of the following, in
    order: the current value of V, a sequence of eight bits of value
    0, random data Z (of the same length as int2octets(x)), a
    sequence of zero bits 000..., the encoding of the (EC)DSA private
    key x, a sequence of zero bits 000..., and the hashed message
    (possibly truncated and extended as specified by the bits2octets
    transform).  The non-negative number of zeroes 000... is chosen
    so that the length of (V || 0x00 || Z || 000...) and
    (int2octets(x) || 000...) are the smallest possible multiples
    of the block size of the hash function. The HMAC result is the
    new value of K.  Note that the private key x is in the [1, q-1]
    range, hence a proper input for int2octets, yielding rlen bits of
    output, i.e., an integral number of octets (rlen is a multiple of 8).

   f.  Set:

          K = HMAC_K(V || 0x01 || Z || 000... || int2octets(x) || 000...
          || bits2octets(h1))

       Note that the "internal octet" is 0x01 this time. The string
       (Z || 000... || int2octets(x) || 000.. || bits2octets(h1)),
       called provided_data in HMAC_DRBG, is the same as in step (d).

   The construction in [RFC6979] can be seen as using HMAC_DRBG
   [SP800-90Ar1] with rejection sampling to generate the ECDSA per-
   message secret number (see Section 3.3 of [RFC6979]).  With the
   updates in this document, Z can be seen as the combination of
   entropy_input and nonce (see the text on "extra strong" entropy input
   in Section 8.6.7 of [SP800-90Ar1]).  The concatenation 000... ||
   int2octets(x) || 000... || bits2octets(h1) can be seen as the
   personalization_string.  See Section 3.3 of [RFC6979] for the other
   parameters.

   When ECDSA is used with SHAKE [SHA3] the HMAC construction above MAY
   be used but it is RECOMMENDED to use the more efficient KMAC
   construction [KMAC].  SHAKE is a variable-length hash function
   defined as SHAKE(M, d) where the output is a d-bits-long digest of
   message M.  When ECDSA is used with SHAKE128(M, d), it is RECOMMENDED
   to replace HMAC(K, M) with KMAC128(K, M, d2, ""), where d2 = max(d,
   qlen) and qlen is the binary length of the order of the base point of
   the elliptic curve [RFC6979].  When ECDSA is used with SHAKE256(M,
   d), it is RECOMMENDED to replace HMAC(K, M) with KMAC256(K, M, d2,
   ""), where d2 = max(d, qlen).  [RFC8692] and [FIPS-186-5] define the
   use of SHAKE128 with an output length of 256 bits and SHAKE256 with
   an output length or 512 bits.

   In new deployments, where side-channel and fault injection attacks
   are a concern, Hedged EdDSA as specified in Section 3 is RECOMMENDED.

5.  Security Considerations

   The constructions in this document follow the high-level approach in
   [XEdDSA] to calculate the per-message secret number from the hash of
   the private key and the message, but add additional randomness into
   the calculation for greater resilience.  This does not re-introduce
   the strong security requirement of randomness needed by randomized
   ECDSA [FIPS-186-5].  The randomness of Z need not be perfect but
   SHALL be generated by a cryptographically secure method and SHALL be
   secret.  Even if the same random number Z is used to sign two
   different messages, the security will be the same as deterministic
   ECDSA and EdDSA and an attacker will not be able to compromise the
   private key with algebraic means as in fully randomized ECDSA
   [FIPS-186-5].  With the construction specified in this document, two
   signatures over two equal messages are different which prevents
   information leakage in use cases where signatures but not messages
   are public.

   The construction in this document aims to mitigate fault injection
   attacks that leverage determinism in deterministic ECDSA and EdDSA
   signatures (see e.g., [ABFJLM17]), by randomizing nonce generation.
   Fault injection attacks that achieve instruction skipping as in e.g.,
   Section 3.4 of [ABFJLM17] are not necessarily stopped.  It seems to
   be possible to, at the same time, also mitigate attacks that use
   first order differential power analysis (DPA) against the hash
   computation of deterministic nonces in EdDSA and ECDSA (see e.g.,
   [ABFJLM17][SBBDS17]).  The Hedged EdDSA construction mitigates the
   referenced first order DPA attacks by mixing prefix with Z before
   mixing it with any public variable data (message or context).
   Similarly, the Hedged ECDSA construction mixes x with a state
   randomized by Z before mixing it with public variable data (h1).  The
   random bytes Z are re-used in step (d) and (f) of Hedged ECDSA to
   align with HMAC_DRBG.  This may make certain DPA attacks easier than
   if randomness had been sampled fresh for each respective step.  Note
   however that V is updated between the steps and that the secret key x
   is processed in a new input block of the hash function after
   processing V and Z in each respective step.

   A key pair MAY be reused between implementations of the hedged
   constructions in this document and the non-hedged original
   constructions in [RFC8032] and Section 3.2 of [RFC6979].  The Hedged
   EdDSA construction in this document randomizes prefix in an
   intermediate step and preserves the domain separation between the
   different variants of EdDSA (see Section 8.6 of [RFC8032]).  The
   Hedged ECDSA construction has a different HMAC input length in step
   (d) (and (f)) of Section 4 than the original construction in
   Section 3.2 of [RFC6979].  It is therefore impossible for an attacker
   to manipulate the parameters to the nonce generation process (between
   the different constructions) such that the HMAC input in step (d) and
   (f) becomes identical for two distinct messages.

   Implementations need to follow best practices on how to protect
   against all side-channel attacks, not just attacks that exploit
   determinism, see for example [BSI].

Change log

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   Changes from -03 to -04:

   *  Resubmission

   Changes from -02 to -03:

   *  Same randomness Z in step d and f to align with HMAC_DRBG.

   *  Changed Hedged EdDSA order to 0x00 || Z || dom2(F, C) instead of
      dom2(F, C) || Z.  This avoids collisions with RFC 8032 and aligns
      with Bernstein's recommendation to put Z before the context.

   *  Changed KMAC output length recommendations to avoid multiple
      invocations.

   *  Updates some text to align with the hedged signatures/signing
      terminology.

   *  Added more description about the construction.

   *  Editorial changes.

   Changes from -01 to -02:

   *  Different names Zd and Zf for the randomness in ECDSA.

   *  Added empty test vector section as TODO.

   Changes from -00 to -01:

   *  Changed terminology to hedged signatures/signing.

   *  Added reference to the FIPS 204 (ML-DSA) where hedged signatures
      are the default.

   *  Added a second 000... padding that separates the context from the
      prefix, aligning with BSI recommendations.

   *  Added note that Z in step f is not reused from step d.

   *  Added note on "internal octet" is 0x01 from RFC 6979.

   *  Removed incorrect statement that context fit in first block.

   *  Added more description about the construction.

   *  Moved "For discussion" section to GitHub issue.

   *  Editorial changes.
